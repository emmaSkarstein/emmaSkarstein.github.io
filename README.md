# My personal webpage

Originally set up using this really helpful template: [https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html](https://crumplab.github.io/LabJournalWebsite/index.html)

Since then, I've turned it into a [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) webpage and blog, with a homepage using [postcards](https://github.com/seankross/postcards).
